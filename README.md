# DataSet
ProcessWire modules for importing, manipulating and displaying large (50k+) data sets.  
The software was developed for the [Mikes-dictionary] and other Digital Humanities projects.

## Main features
* import data from CSV and XML sources
* user configurable input <-> field mappings and dynamic field composition
* supports downloading external resources (files, images)
* handles page references (including references by any or multiple fields)
* merge new data into already existing pages
* overwrite old data with new one
* merge several input data into a single field
* supports numeric option fields
* fairly low memory requirements (uses [Tasker](https://github.com/mtwebit/Tasker) to execute long-running import jobs)
