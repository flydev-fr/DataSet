# DataSet
ProcessWire modules for importing, manipulating and displaying large data sets.

## Notes
Use with caution: it is under continuous development. Things may be broken and the API may change at any time.  
PW 3.0.62 has a bug and needs manual fix for conditional hooks.
See [this issue](https://github.com/processwire/processwire-issues/issues/261) for a fix or upgrade to the latest dev.

## Purpose
These modules provides support for importing, storing, manipulating and displaying large number of data entries in ProcessWire.  
They can handle 50k+ entries with low memory requirements. Imports are run using the [Tasker](https://github.com/mtwebit/Tasker) module.  
The software was developed for the [Mikes-dictionary] and other Digital Humanities projects.
